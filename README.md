Dataset: supply link to data file

Description: Data collected from journals (original research only) currently in the best quartile (Q1) of Cell Biology category from https://www.scimagojr.com/, also included Cell and Nature (more general)
Publication date range limited to 2019, two figures from each paper, 5 papers per journal max, some fewer if criteria not met

Variables:
	1. include: data included in analysis (yes or no)- some data excluded due to limitation of 2 figures/article, incorrect design type, no statistical analysis, etc.
	2. doi: digital object identifier
	3. journal: name of publication
	4. rank: Measure of journal's impact from SCImago Journal Rank Indicator (Cell Biology subject category)
	5. quartile: Q1 is best quartile from SCImago Journal Rank Indicator	
	6. year: publication year
	7. issue: journal issue number (if none, assigned a value of 1)
	8. author: last name of first author
	9. title: article title
	10. fig id: figures randomly selected for analysis
	11. design: experimental design	(example, 2 factors with 3 levels = 3x2)
	12. data availability: raw data availability
	13. reported sample size: sample size reported for statistical analysis
	14. analysis: flat (unable to measure interaction) vs. factorial (able to measure interaction)	
	15. t-tests: combined or separate
	16: tests: tests performed for statistical analysis
	17. post hoc: tests performed after initial analysis upon rejection of the null hypothesis to determine significant differences 
	18. ixn reported: interaction reported (yes or no)
	19. comment: additional comments regarding analysis
	20. report: how figure results were reported in the text
	21. synergy used: term "synergy" used statistically
	22. antagonism used: term "antagonism" used statistically
	23. ixn to support syn/ant: interaction reported to justify statistical use of "synergy" and/or "antagonism"
